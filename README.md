# Terraform-deploys-Apache
This project is a terraform script used to provision an infrastructure on aws as well as deploying Apache web server on the infrastructure.

These are the commands to run for the terraform script:

## terraform init
The terraform init command will initialize the working directory containing Terraform configuration files and install any required plugins. Note: The terraform init command is safe to run multiple times, to bring the working directory up to date with changes in the configuration.

## terraform plan
The terraform plan command creates an execution plan, which allows you preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure. This will also help you know which changes to be made and which errors are there to be corrected.

## terraform apply
Creates or updates infrastructure depending on the configuration files.
